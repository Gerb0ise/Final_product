# Project 25: Modelling Magnetic Resonance using QuTiP

## Overview
This project was undertaken by a group of students of the Maastricht University in January 2022. A report was written and can be found as a pdf in this repository. Furthermore, two Jupyter notebooks were developed with the aim to provide an understanding of magnetic resonance. It provides a step by step explanation of relevant concepts with helpful visualisation plots and animations.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisite.txt file provides the python dependencies necessary for the proper compilation of the code.\
A quick and simple way of opening and interacting with the notebooks is to open them on binder through the following link:\
